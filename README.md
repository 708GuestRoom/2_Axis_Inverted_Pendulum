# 2_Axis_Inverted_Pendulum

Continuation of my senior capstone project. The original project ended in moderate success.

The original project: 

  Had a working chassis

  Had working power, motors, wiring

  Utilized LQR controls
  
  Had semi-working controls integration uploaded to an Arduino

The new project will:

  Have a working chassis
  
  Have working power, motors, wiring
  
  Utilize LQR controls with and without a Kalman Filter 
  
  Utilize ML to control the system
  
  Be able to switch between the two systems as well as configure the K values for the LQR controls with an RPi
  
  Integrate the controls with the motors/electronics using an Arduino
  
  Be able to interface the RPi with the Arduino
